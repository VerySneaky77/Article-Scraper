# Video Game News Scraper

### Overview

Scrape video game news articles and save favorites to a database.

### About

Articles are scraped from a remote site and displayed to the visitor. The visitor can choose articles to save to a noSQL database for later referenced. Saved articles can be commented on by a visitor, which are then associated and saved in the same noSQL database.

### Unmet

Articles are currently unable to saved by the user due to time constraints in building handlebars templates. The script functionality for saving and loading articles from the database is in this app, however there is no front-end available for the visitor to utilize these functions. This is due to the time lost in attempting and failing to implement these tools via handlebar view templates.

### Future Improvements

More experience with handlebars would have saved time in failing to render content for proper testing. As it is, only a static page renders.
